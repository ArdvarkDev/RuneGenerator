# Rune Generator

A simple program that generates 5x7px magic runes for use in games projects (or other stuff, I guess)

![Example output](https://github.com/ArdvarkDev/RuneGenerator/blob/master/example_output.png?raw=true)

No idea how to finagle gradle into giving me a jar that actually is able to be run, so build it yourself or whatever

### How to build/run
1. Make sure you have java installed
2. run `$ ./gradlew build` and `$ ./gradlew run`
3. enjoy
